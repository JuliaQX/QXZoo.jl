# QXZoo.jl Documentation

*QXZoo.jl* is a generator suite for quantum algorithms. Using a high-level approach to quantum circuit design, we create quantum circuits taking note of all intermediate gate-calls between qubits, performing operation caching and optimisation where possible. 

Currently, we support a limited set of quantum algorithms (see the `MAnual/Algorithms` dropdown for details). Details of the circuit generator modules and structs are given in the `Gates` and `Circuits` dropdowns.
